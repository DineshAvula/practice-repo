#README.md file

.md -- Markdown file -- similar to markdown in Jupyter notebook.

Markdown has some shortcuts like a single #, which represents the main header.

#Git
'Git' is a version control system. It is free and open source. 

#Version control
Version control is the way through which the programmers track the changes in the code.
We basically save an initial version of our code into Git. When we update the code then we can save it into Git again. 
As we go on making the changes, if we want, we can look book at all the changes we have made to our code.
Basically, it helps us to understand what we did and when we did it.

#Terms
Repository -- It is the place where we put our code (or) save our code.
Git -- It is the tool that tracks the changes in our files over time i.e. it helps us in version control.
Github  -- It is the website where we host all of our Git repositories.

#Git commands -- all the commands are in lower case
clone -- Say, there is a repository that is not present on our local machine but it is on github and we want to bring it onto our local machine.
add -- when we have updated, created or deleted files and folders, we will want to tell Git that we have made changes and we want Git to track them. We use 'add'.
commit -- we know that Git is used to save the changes tha we have made in the code. Once, we 'commit', we are saving those changes in Git i.e. we are committin those changes.
push -- once we have made the changes locally on our computer and we are ready to put them on Git, we tell Git to track them through the 'add' command, we save our files to Git through the 'commit' command. 
And then we save (or) upload our files to a remote repository like 'Github' or 'Bitbucket'. We do this through 'push' command.
pull -- when there are changes to our code on Github and we want to download those to our local machine,we use 'pull' command i.e. we 'pull' down those changes from the repository.


#Create README.md -- it is the place holder text. If we do not write anything, it is taken as default.

#Say, we want to know see all the commits we have performed. We can see it in the --> code --> file --> upper right corner.
We can see that each commit has a unique identifier. 

#Green with '+' means that the line has been added to the file.
#Red with '-' means that the line has been deleted from the file.
#White means that it remained the same.

#In Mac and Linux machines, Git is inherently installed.
